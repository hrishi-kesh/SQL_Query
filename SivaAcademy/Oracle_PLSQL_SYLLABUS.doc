Collections: Working with collections such as PL/SQL tables, nested tables, and VARRAYs.

2. Performance Tuning and Optimization
SQL Query Optimization: Techniques to optimize SQL queries, including proper use of indexes, understanding execution plans, and Oracle optimizer hints.
PL/SQL Optimization: Techniques like bulk binding, avoiding row-by-row processing, and optimizing loop operations.
DBMS_PROFILER: Using Oracle’s built-in profiling tools to find performance bottlenecks in PL/SQL code.
Efficient Use of Bind Variables: Understanding and using bind variables to improve performance and prevent SQL injection.

3. Database Design & Architecture
Normalization and Denormalization: Understanding and applying normalization techniques for optimal database design.
Partitioning: Using partitioned tables for handling large datasets and improving query performance.

Materialized Views: Implementing materialized views for query optimization and data replication.

4. Advanced Error Handling
Exception Handling: Best practices for managing exceptions at different levels of code (within procedures, triggers, etc.).
Custom Exceptions: Defining and using user-defined exceptions for specific application needs.

5. Oracle Database Features
Oracle Scheduler: Automating tasks and managing schedules using DBMS_SCHEDULER.
Advanced Queues: Understanding and using Oracle AQ (Advanced Queuing) for messaging and inter-process communication.
DBMS_UTILITY: Utilizing Oracle’s built-in packages for managing file I/O, LOBs (large objects), and more.
DBMS_LOB: Handling large object data types, including CLOBs and BLOBs, and using appropriate methods for LOB data manipulation.

6. Database Security
Roles and Privileges: Managing user privileges and roles to secure sensitive data.
Virtual Private Database (VPD): Understanding VPD for implementing row-level security in the database.
Data Encryption: Use of Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and DBMS_CRYPTO for securing sensitive data.

7. Data Integration and ETL Processes
Data Loading and Migration: Using Oracle tools such as SQL*Loader and Data Pump for loading and exporting large datasets.
External Tables: Utilizing external tables for data extraction from flat files.
ETL Development: Implementing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes using PL/SQL and integrating with external data sources.

8. Advanced Transaction Management
Savepoints and Rollbacks: Using savepoints for partial rollbacks and managing complex transactions.
Autonomous Transactions: Implementing and managing autonomous transactions for independent transactional processing.
Distributed Transactions: Understanding and handling distributed transactions across multiple databases.

9. Advanced PL/SQL Packages
DBMS_SQL: Working with dynamic SQL using the DBMS_SQL package for more complex operations.
DBMS_JOB vs DBMS_SCHEDULER: Understanding the differences and when to use each for scheduling database jobs.
DBMS_CRYPTO: Implementing encryption and decryption methods to secure database communication and storage.

10. Reporting and Data Analysis
Advanced SQL Queries: Using analytical functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, LAG), subqueries, and hierarchical queries (e.g., CONNECT BY).
PL/SQL for Reports: Generating complex reports with pivoting data, using CASE and DECODE functions for better data presentation.
Oracle Analytic Functions: Usage of functions like LAG(), LEAD(), NTILE(), and RANK() for advanced data analysis.

11. PL/SQL Best Practices and Standards
Modular Programming: Writing modular code using packages and procedures to promote reusability and maintainability.
Code Versioning: Using version control tools like Git (Bitbucket) for managing PL/SQL code.
Code Reviews: Performing thorough code reviews to ensure performance, security, and adherence to best practices.

12. Backup and Recovery
Oracle Data Pump: Using Data Pump for backing up and restoring databases and for database migrations.
RMAN (Recovery Manager): Understanding the basics of RMAN for performing backups and recovery operations.
Flashback Technology: Utilizing Oracle Flashback for fast data recovery.

13. Database Monitoring and Diagnostics
Oracle AWR (Automatic Workload Repository): Using AWR reports for monitoring database performance.
ADDM (Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor): Using ADDM reports to identify performance issues and recommendations.
SQL Tuning Advisor: Using tuning tools to identify and resolve SQL performance issues.

14. Agile/DevOps Integration
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Working with CI/CD pipelines for database deployment automation.
Collaboration Tools: Using Jira, Bitbucket, Jenkins, or similar tools for project tracking, collaboration, and automated deployments.

15. Soft Skills
Mentorship: Mentoring junior developers in writing efficient PL/SQL code and following best practices.
Documentation: Writing detailed technical documentation for procedures, packages, and system designs.
Collaboration: Working closely with DBA teams, application developers, and business analysts to deliver optimal solutions.
Additional Areas (Optional but Relevant):
Oracle Cloud (OCI): Experience with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, especially for developers working in cloud environments.
Oracle Apex (Application Express): If applicable, knowledge of Oracle Apex for building web-based applications on Oracle databases.
